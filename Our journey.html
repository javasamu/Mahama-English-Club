  <i><h3>Our activities since 2015</h3></i>
  
  <p>Mahama English Club started its activities since 2015. The members of this club wanted to improve 
  their skills by learning English as one among two international languages beside French.
  During this journey, they got a supportor, Anne Down Moretti who helped them achieving their ambitions.
  In 2016, she provided smart phones to some of Club members which helped them connect on different social media 
  and learn effeciantly. In 2017, she pivoted and gave dictionaries, uniforms, and pens to 300 students 
  who were tought by their fellow mentors. Each member of this club has to be on social media. This was 
  her ambution. She came again from New York to Rwanda and provided 175 smart Phones to other round of
  club members. She kept on pivoting in different ways and provided more than 180 
  Smart Phones to the rest of Club members in October 2021. All club members are now on socail media. These actions done
  by mum helped students who were studying their high school to perform well in national exams. Some of them succeeded well 
  in National exam and others attended different uninversities because of what she did for them.  Bellow 
  are pictures taken during those activities.</p>

"If you can't fly, then run,if you can't run then walk, if can't walif you canâ€™t run then walk, if you can't walk, then crawl,bot whatever you do,you have to keep moving forward." by Martin Luther King.
In 2019, She didn't get the opportunity of coming in Rwanda and schools were closed because of covid-19. 
All activities stopped running.However, she encouraged all high school graduates to apply for distinguished universities. 
Six students joined Davis College/Akilah in August 2020, and Seventeen joined March 2021. She didn't stopped this program because 30 students also joined in August 2021. The total number of students who are sponsored by this beloved mum are 53 in total.
There are others who got ALU and Kepler scholarships. They are all members of this familly, Mahama English Club.</p></i>
<p>This Club is becoming a Worldwide Club because of its improvements. Anne Moretti is still supporting all club members(who stay in Camp, who are outside of the camp, and students).
 No one left behind trough this program. </p>
